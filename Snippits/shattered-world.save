## Places and Peoples

Shattered world is made up of three planes. 

##### The Skylands: 
These are floating landmasses that range from 3000 to 5000 meters off the surface. they are suspended over a dense cloud layer that obstructs view of the surface beneath. The "elevated" peoples live here. they believe they are the only life on the planet and that nothing exists beneath. this is reinforced through religious dogma. 

##### The Surface:
This is a barren and disheveled place. Great sections of the surface have been torn free leaving behind massive fissures, Acid rains down from the ever present cloud cover. Remnants of civilizations past scatter the surface, great stonework (concete) cities, and metal statues (mechs/robots) dot the landscape in various states of disrepair. There are few peoples that live on the surface, none of which have formed what would be considered a "society". 

##### The Underdark:
Deep beneath the Surface civilization lives again. down within the bedrock lie cities upon cities of people, interconnected by tunnels created by civilizations long past. The people who dwell here are different than their "elevated" bretheren, changed by their environment and lack of sunlight. Might makes Right is the common theme amongst the people of the underdark, with few exceptions.

## The Skylands: In Depth

This chapter covers the Skylands, her peoples and places of interest. 

### Geography

There are six major landmasses that make up the Skylands, amongst multitudes of smaller islands. 

##### Rusk
Rusk is the largest of the major islands, spanning nearly 2000 miles in width and breadth. 
the north and eastern borders of the island are great mountains, protecting a central plain that streches over 80% of the islands surface, the southern border forms a dense woodland, while the eastern border delves into sheet cliffs. 

##### Island 2
##### Island 3
##### Island 4
##### Island 5
##### Island 6
##### Island 7

### Culture, Religion, & Landmarks

#### Rusk

##### Culture:
The peoples of Rusk are mainly agrarian, living in a feudal state under a supreme monarch known as the Czar. The Czar maintains a standing militia force, despite being in control of the entire land. Any rebellions against the Czar's rule are quickly and violently extinguished. A second presence in Rusk with nearly as much influence as the Czar, is the Church of the Orthodox, Who grant rulership of Rusk to the Czar as a divine right. 
While the Czar's power comes from ownership of the land and military might, the Church is much more subtle in its mechanations. With outposts in every village and hamlet in Rusk, the church is able to feel the will of the people and direct them as a community. Crime amongst the people is handled as a church matter, instead of one involving the Men of the Czar. Though, in some cases, those committing the crime will flee to the Czar's justice, as it will be more merciful than the church.

There us a strct Class Sysem to the people of Rusk

The Laymen: These are the core of the population of rusk. The Farmers, the Tradesmen, all given grant to their way of life with the Czar's blessing. 
The Freemen: These are the peoples who fall outside of the norms. the Third sons, or unwed daughters. They do not have the grant of the Czar, so they find work where they can. Many freemen are Itenerant. 
The Clergy: The people of the church. both Laymen and Freemen can increase their station in life through service to the church, however the chuch is selective and accepts only those they have need for. 
The Armsmen: The Czar's standing militia. Made up of familys that have served the Czar faithfully for generations. The armsmen act as the Czar's will throughout the land. 
 

##### Religion:
The Church of the Orthodox is unique in that it is ingraned into the daily lives of the people of Rusk. Banking, Councils, DIsputes, Births and Marrages, are all handled under the guise of church officials.  The Symbol of the church is deemed rather odd by many outside of rusk, it is the image of a sword, driven point into the ground, with a man bound to it at wrist and ankle forming a T.  The symbol of the sword alone is worn by many of the people of Rusk as a totem of protection.
