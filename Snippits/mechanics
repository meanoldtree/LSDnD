weapon such as a sword, hammer, or axe.

#Inteligence

polititions.

Skills:

During Character Creation players will select up to 4 tradeskills that match their archetype. Each skill adds +5 to a roll that is related to that skill, this is 
stacked with the corrispondin core stat, allowing for a good size boost to player rolls. 

An example list of Skills are included in Appendix A


Leveling:
Shattered World takes a different approcah to levling and skills compared to many other fantasy role-playing systems. Characters advance from Level 0 through to 
Level 5. Upon each level up characters gain 2 attribute points that they can assign to their core stats as the player sees fit. Once a character meets max level 
they may advance in Tiers, these tiers are awarded as a boon from heroic acts or reaching campaing milestones. There are two types of Tiers that a character 
can be granted; Additional Tradeskills or Advanced Mechanics. 

Advanced Mechanics:
There are times that you want to really add flavor to a player character outside of equipment or skills, This is where Advanced Mechanics come into play. Each 
Player character may be granted one Advanced Mechanic upon reaching level 5, and additional ones through leveling tiers. A word of caution, care should be taken 
when implementing Advanced Mechaincs, as it can quickly unbalance the game. Two Advanced Mechaics are detailed below, additional Advanced Mechanic examples can 
be found in Appendix A. 

# Backstab - Theif
# During Combat: 
# While undetected by combat target, ignore enemy defense bonuses. 
# on sucessful hit roll double weapon damage
# if one roll is a critical sucsess, double both rolls. 

# Facestab - Rogue
# During Combat:
# If Penetration roll excedes Defense by double the amount, roll double weapon damage
# Add Rolls together, if Critical Sucess, double damage amount.

Penetration VS Defense:

When attacking a character must make a Penetration roll, this is compared to the opposing characters defense value. if Defense is greater than Penetration the 
attack may make contact but does no damage. This works better than an evasion stat in practice as the Tank in Steel Plate armor is not going to dodge out of the 
way of a club, its just going to bounce off.
