#Overview

Character sheets are created in Google Sheets. 

A folder is created with all of the appropriate files. this is the Game Binder Shattered World has one that also includes PDFs of the campaign setting

IN LSDnD there are 6 Character Slots. There is a pre-formed character sheet for each slot. IF a character needs to be imported, their sheet can be renamed and 
dropped into the appropriate slot

The DM Journal not only references all of the character sheets, but it allows for notes and has derived stats not avalible on the character's sheet

The Main sheet of the DM Journal has a view of all 6 characters; name, ability scores, static bonuses to defense and penetration, current weapons equiped, 
funds, ect.

The next sheet is a general notes sheet, designed to be used while the game is running to record events. 

the next several sheets are resourses for Shattered World, including NPC and location generation, weapon and item lists, alchemical primers and guide.

The last several sheets are cloned in from the character sheets, allowing the DM to browse characters without leaving the journal

Character sheets can be shared out individually via link sharing to prevent players from spying on eachother should intrigue arise. additionally it helps in that 
other players cannot edit a sheet they do not own. 

additionally, with shared update tracking a GM can see what changes were made and when to a character sheet, this allows for easy discovery of cheating.
